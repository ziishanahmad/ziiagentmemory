## Retrieval Accuracy (LongMemEval)

[LongMemEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813) (ICLR 2025) measures long-term memory retrieval across ~48 sessions per question on the S variant (500 questions, ~115K tokens each).

| System | Benchmark | R@5 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ZiiAgentMemory** (BM25 + Vector) | LongMemEval-S | **95.2%** | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings, no API key |
| ZiiAgentMemory (BM25-only) | LongMemEval-S | 86.2% | Fallback when no embedding provider available |
| MemPalace | LongMemEval-S | ~96.6% (self-reported) | Vendor-published number we have not independently reproduced. Vector-only with a larger embedding model and no agent-integration surface (no hooks, no MCP, no multi-agent) |
| oracleagentmemory | LongMemEval | 94.4% (self-reported) | Vendor-published, scored with GPT-5.5 at "xhigh reasoning" and requires an Oracle AI Database. We have not reproduced it. ZiiAgentMemory's 95.2% uses free local embeddings and no API key |
| Letta / MemGPT | LoCoMo | 83.2% | Different benchmark (LoCoMo, not LongMemEval) |
| Mem0 | LoCoMo | 68.5% | Different benchmark (LoCoMo, not LongMemEval) |

**⚠️ Apples vs oranges caveat:** only ZiiAgentMemory's 95.2% is our own measured result, reproducible from the methodology below. Every other number here is the vendor's published claim, on a different benchmark or harness, that we have not independently reproduced: MemPalace and oracleagentmemory report LongMemEval (oracleagentmemory's run used GPT-5.5 at "xhigh reasoning" against an Oracle AI Database), while Letta and Mem0 publish on [LoCoMo](https://snap-stanford.github.io/LoCoMo/). Treat them as ballpark vendor claims, not a head-to-head on identical data. We'd love to run every system on the same dataset; if any maintainer wants to collaborate, open an issue.

## Token Efficiency

The main reason to use persistent memory at all: token cost. Here's what one year of heavy agent use looks like across approaches.

| Approach | Tokens / year | Cost / year | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paste full history into context | 19.5M+ | Impossible | Exceeds context window after ~200 observations |
| LLM-summarized memory (extraction-based) | ~650K | ~$500 | Lossy — summarization drops detail |
| **ZiiAgentMemory (API embeddings)** | **~170K** | **~$10** | Token-budgeted, only relevant memories injected |
| **ZiiAgentMemory (local embeddings)** | **~170K** | **$0** | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` runs in-process |
| supermemory | Not published | Cloud pricing | Managed API, no local token budget |
| Mem0 | Varies by integration | Varies | Extraction-based, no token budget |

**ZiiAgentMemory ships with a built-in token savings calculator.** Run `npx ziiagentmemory status` after a few sessions and you'll see exactly how many tokens you've saved vs. pasting the full history.

## What Each Tool Is Best At

This isn't a "ZiiAgentMemory wins everything" page. Different tools solve different problems.

**Choose ZiiAgentMemory if you want:**
- Automatic capture with zero manual `add()` calls
- MCP server that works across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.
- Hybrid BM25 + vector + graph search
- Real-time viewer to see what your agent is learning
- Self-hostable with zero external databases
- Privacy filtering on API keys and secrets
- Multi-agent coordination (leases, signals, routines)

**Choose Mem0 if you want:**
- Framework-agnostic API to bolt onto an existing agent
- Managed cloud option with a dashboard
- Python + TypeScript SDKs for direct integration
- Entity/relationship extraction as the primary abstraction

**Choose Letta/MemGPT if you want:**
- A full agent runtime, not just memory
- OS-inspired memory tiers (core/archival/recall)
- Agents that self-edit their memory via function calls
- Long-running conversational agents (weeks/months)

**Choose Khoj if you want:**
- A personal AI second brain, not agent infrastructure
- Document-first search over your files and the web
- Obsidian/Notion/Emacs integrations
- Scheduled automations and research tasks

**Choose supermemory if you want:**
- A managed memory API with server-side auto-extraction and automatic forgetting
- Drop-in wrappers for major AI frameworks (Vercel AI, LangChain, LangGraph)
- A hosted dashboard with no infrastructure to run yourself
- RAG plus memory served from a single query

**Choose MemPalace if you want:**
- A simple, free, open-source vector memory store
- To chase its self-reported retrieval benchmark (we have not reproduced it)
- Pure retrieval over agent workflow features
- Note: no auto-capture, no MCP, no multi-agent coordination, so you wire all integration yourself

**Choose oracleagentmemory if you want:**
- You already run on Oracle AI Database and want memory inside it
- Enterprise Oracle stack with vector search in the same database
- LLM-backed extraction and are fine paying for a frontier model (their benchmark used GPT-5.5)
- Note: Python-only, Oracle Database required, no MCP, no real-time viewer

**Choose Hippo if you want:**
- Biologically-inspired memory model (decay, consolidation, sleep)
- Multi-agent shared memory as a primary feature
- "Forget by default, earn persistence through use" philosophy

## Running Your Own Benchmarks

We encourage you to measure this yourself rather than trust any README. Here's how:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ziishanahmad/ziiagentmemory.git
cd ZiiAgentMemory && npm install

# Run LongMemEval-S
npm run bench:longmemeval

# Run quality benchmark (240 observations, 20 queries)
npm run bench:quality

# Run scale benchmark
npm run bench:scale

# Run real embeddings benchmark
npm run bench:real-embeddings
```

Results land in `benchmark/results/`. All scripts, datasets, and results are committed for reproducibility.

If you want to add your tool to this comparison, open a PR with:
1. A link to your benchmark methodology
2. The metric and dataset you're measuring on
3. A commit hash / version so we can reproduce
