ZiiAgentMemory is a memory server for coding agents. It runs locally, captures observations, indexes them for hybrid retrieval, and serves them back over REST and MCP. It is built on the iii engine.

## iii primitives

Everything is a function, a trigger, or worker state on the iii engine. There is no separate plugin system; the worker registers functions (`mem::*`) and HTTP triggers (`api::*`) and the engine routes calls. ZiiAgentMemory does not bypass iii; new capability is a new function plus a trigger.

## Retrieval model

Recall is hybrid: BM25 keyword search plus vector similarity plus graph expansion over linked concepts. The default install needs no API key because embeddings run on-device and BM25 needs none. An LLM provider only adds richer summaries and auto-injection, both opt-in.

## Storage and lifecycle

Memories carry content, concepts, files, importance, and timestamps, grouped into sessions and optionally linked to commits. A lifecycle of capture, compress, consolidate, and forget keeps the store useful over time rather than letting it grow unbounded.

## Ports

REST is the anchor at 3111. Streams = N+1 (3112), viewer = N+2 (3113), engine = N+46023 (49134). `--instance N` shifts the whole block by N*100.

## Viewer

A real-time web viewer at `http://localhost:3113` shows memory building as sessions run. Useful for demos and for confirming capture is working.
